## Reducing Emissions in Car Carriers: An AI-Based Alert System

As a kid me and my parents often went to places like Sardinia or some greek Island. As we wanted to take our car with us, we always used an auto ferry to get there. Life was good, until we got to the moment of disembarking. All passengers were called to the car decks to wait by their cars. These decks can get quite warm, especially in the mediterranian summer, so a lot of people had the idea to get into their cars and turn the engine on in order to get the air conditioning to work. While this was nice for them, it is not ideal to have a lot of cars with engines running in a confined space with limited ventilation, as this further increases the temperature and, more importantly, increases the amount of exhaust fumes all passengers outside of cars have to breath. While there were signs that said it is not allowed to leave the car off, the sailors where too busy with the docking operation to enforce this.
With this project we wanted to create an AI that can be used to recognise the sound of idling engines in order to give automated warnings, either visual or acoustic. This can be applied to any place where cars are not supposed to be left running in confined spaces, like ships, enclosed trains and so on.


### 1. The data
We took the database from kaggle [8kUrbanSounds database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chrisfilo/urbansound8k). This data set contains urban sounds (including engine idling) in .wav file of lenght of up to 4 seconds.

### 2. Preprocessing

Firstly we extended the audio files to a fixed lenght

### 3. Our model
